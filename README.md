# Forest_Fire_Detection

Forest Fire Detection using Deep Learning

Overview

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect forest fires from images. The model classifies images as either containing a wildfire or not, using a dataset sourced from Kaggle.

Features

Detects wildfires from image data.

Uses deep learning for classification.

Supports GPU acceleration for faster training.

Installation

Ensure you have Python and install the required dependencies:

pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib kagglehub

Usage

Run the notebook to:

Load the dataset.

Train the model.

Classify images for wildfire detection.
